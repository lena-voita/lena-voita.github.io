<h3 id="mt_training">Machine Translation Task: Traditional vs Neural Mindsets</h3>


<p>In the last couple of decades, the two main machine translation paradigms have been statistical and neural MT (SMT
    and NMT).

    Classical SMT splits the translation task into several components corresponding
    to the competences which researchers think the model should have. The typical components are:
    <font face="arial">target-side
        language model</font>, <font face="arial">lexical translation model</font>, and a
    <font face="arial">reordering model</font>. Overall, in SMT different competences
    are modelled with distinct model components which are trained separately and then put together
    in a translation model.
</p>

</center>

<img src="../resources/posts/nmt_training/main_question-min.png" style="max-width:30%; margin-left:30px;float:right;"/>
<p>Differently, in NMT, the whole translation task is modelled with a single neural network.
    While NMT is the de-facto standard paradigm,
    it is still not clear <font face="arial">how and when NMT acquires these competences during training</font>.
</p>
<p>For example, are there any stages where
    NMT focuses on fluency or adequacy, or does it improve everything at the same rate? Does it learn
    word-by-word translation first and more complicated patterns later, or is there a different behavior?
</p>

<h4><u>We know</u>: NMT training has distinct stages</h4>

<p>This is especially interesting in light of
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10907.pdf" target="_blank">our ACL 2021 paper</a> (here's the
    <a href="https://lena-voita.github.io/posts/source_target_contributions_to_nmt.html" target="_blank">blog
        post</a>!). There we looked at a model’s
    inner working (namely, how the predictions are formed) and we saw that the training process is non-monotonic,
    which means that there are stages with qualitatively different changes.

<p>Differently, now we look at the model’s output and focus on the competences related to three core SMT
    components: target-side language modeling, lexical translation, and reordering.</p>
<!--<p>For more details on the previous work, you can look through the
    <a href="https://lena-voita.github.io/posts/source_target_contributions_to_nmt.html" target="_blank">blog
        post on the ACL 2021 paper on source and target contributions to NMT predictions</a>.
    But here let's come further.
</p>-->

<h4><u>We look at</u>: LM scores, translation quality, monotonicity of alignments</h4>
<p>For these competences, we evaluate language modeling scores, translation quality and
monotonicity of alignments.</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/nmt_training/what_we_evaluate-min.png" style="max-width:80%; margin-bottom:10px; "/>
</center>


<h3>Target-Side Language Modeling</h3>

<p>Let’s start with the language modeling scores. Here the x-axis shows the training step. We see that most of
    the change happens at the beginning of training. Also, the scores peak much higher than that of references
    (shown with the dashed line here). This means that the model probably generates very frequent n-grams
    rather than diverse texts similar to references.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/nmt_inside_out/lm_scores-min.png" style="max-width:100%; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
</center>

<p>Let’s look at this early stage more closely and consider KenLM models with different context lengths:
    from bigram to 5-gram models. We see that for some part of training, scores for simpler models
    are higher than for the more complicated ones. For example, the 2-gram score is the highest and the
    5-gram score is the lowest. This means that the model generates frequent words and n-grams, but larger
    subsequences are not necessarily fluent.
</p>

<p>Below is an example of how a translation evolves at this early stage. This is English-German,
    our source sentence is <span class="data_text"><strong>six months of construction works, that’s brutal</strong></span>.
    On the left are model translations, and on the right is their approximate version in English.
</p>

<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/nmt_inside_out/lm_stage_example-min.png" style="max-width:100%; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
</center>

<p>We see that first, the model hallucinates the most frequent token, then bigram, the three-gram, then
    combinations of frequent phrases. After that, words related to the source start to appear, and only
    later we see something reasonable.
</p>


<h3>Translation Quality</h3>

<p>Let’s now turn to translation quality. In addition to the BLEU score (which is the standard automatic
    evaluation metric for machine translation), we also show token-level accuracy for target tokens
    of different frequency ranks. Token-level accuracy is the proportion of cases where the correct next
    token is the most probable choice. Note that this is exactly what the model is trained to do: in a
    classification setting, it is trained to predict the next token.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/nmt_inside_out/translation_quality.gif" style="max-width:80%; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
</center>

<p>We see that for rare tokens, accuracy improves slower than for the rest. This is expected: rare phenomena
    are learned later in training.
    <font face="arial">What is not clear</font>, is what happens during the last half of the training:
    changes in both BLEU and
    accuracy are almost invisible, even for rare tokens.
</p>


<h3>Monotonicity of Alignments</h3>

<p>Luckily, we have one more thing to look at: monotonicity of alignments. The graph shows how the monotonicity
    of alignments changes during training. For more details on the metric, look at
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01396" target="_blank">the paper</a>,
    but everything we need to know now is that lower scores mean less monotonic (or more complicated)
    alignments in generated translations.
</p>

<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/nmt_inside_out/alignments.gif" style="max-width:80%; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
</center>

<p>First, let's look again at the second half of the training we just looked at. While changes
    in quality are almost invisible, reorderings change significantly. In the absolute values
    this does not look like a lot, a bit later I’ll show you some examples and how this analysis
    can be used in practice to improve non-autoregressive NMT - you’ll see that these changes are quite prominent.
</p>

<p>What is interesting, is that changes in the alignments are visible even after the model converges
    in terms of BLEU. This relates to one of our previous works on context-aware NMT
    (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1116/" target="_blank">Voita et al, 2019</a>): we observed
    that even after BLEU converges, discourse phenomena continue to improve.
</p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples of how translations change during this last part of the training:
    the examples are for English-German and English-Russian, and same-colored chunks are approximately
    aligned to each other.
</p>

<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/nmt_inside_out/alignment_example.gif" style="max-width:100%; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
</center>

<p>I don’t expect you to understand all the translations,
    but visually we can see that first, the translations are almost word-by-word,
    then the reordering becomes more complicated. For example, for English-Russian,
    the last phrase (shown in green) finally gets reordered to the beginning of the sentence.
    Note that the reorderings at these later training steps are more natural for the corresponding target language.
</p>


<h3>Characterizing Training Stages</h3>

<p>Summarizing all the observations, we can say that NMT training undergoes three stages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>target-side language modeling,</li>
    <li>learning how to use source and approaching word-by-word translation,</li>
    <li>refining translations, which is visible only by changes in the reordering and not visible by standard metrics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s look at how these results agree with the stages we looked at in the
    <a href="https://lena-voita.github.io/posts/source_target_contributions_to_nmt.html" target="_blank"> ACL 2021 paper</a>.
</p>

<center>
<video width="90%" height="auto" style="margin: 15px;" loop autoplay muted>
  <source src="../resources/posts/nmt_training/stages.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>

<p>
    First, the source contribution goes down. Here the model relies on the target-side prefix
    and ignores the source, and looking at translations confirmed that here it learns language modeling.
    Then, the source contribution increases rapidly: the model starts to use the source, and we saw
    that the quality improves quickly. After these two stages, translations are close to word-by-word ones.
    Finally, where very little is going on, reorderings continue to become significantly more complicated.
</p>


<h3>Practical Applications of the Analysis</h3>


<p>Finally, not only this is fun, but it can also be useful in practice. First, there are various settings
    where data complexity is important: therefore, translations from specific training stages can be useful.
    Next, there are a lot of SMT-inspired modeling modifications, and our analysis can help modeling modifications.

<h4>Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation</h4>

<p>We focus only on the first point, and as an example considers non-autoregressive NMT.
    For non-autoregressive models, it is standard to use sequence-level distillation. This means that
    targets for these models are not references but translations from an autoregressive teacher.

<p>Previous work showed that complexity of the distilled data matters, and varying it can improve a model.

    While usually, a teacher is a fully converged model, we propose to use as teachers intermediate checkpoints
    during model’s training to get targets of varying complexity. For example, these earlier translations have
    more monotonic alignments.

<p>Let us look at a vanilla non-autoregressive model trained with different teachers.
    The standard teacher is the fully converged model,
    in this case after 200k training steps. But earlier checkpoints, for example after 40k-steps,
    have not much worse BLEU score, but significantly more monotonic alignments.
    And using these less trained teachers improves a vanilla NAT model by <font face="arial">more than 1 bleu</font>!

<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>during training, NMT undergoes three different stages:</li>
    <ul style="margin-left:30px;">
        <li>target-side language modeling,</li>
        <li>learning how to use source and approaching word-by-word translation,</li>
        <li>refining translations, visible by increasingly complex reorderings,
            but almost invisible to standard metrics (e.g. BLEU);</li>
    </ul>
    <li>this is true not only for the standard encoder-decoder Transformer, but also
        for other models (e.g. LSTM) and modeling paradigms (e.g. LM-style NMT) - for this, see
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01396" target="_blank">the paper</a>;
    </li>
    <li>not only this is fun, but it can also help in practice! For example, in settings where
        data complexity matters, such as non-autoregressive NMT.
    </li>
</ul>
