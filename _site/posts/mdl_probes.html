<h3>How to understand if a model captures a linguistic property?</h3>

How would you understand whether a model (e.g., ELMO, BERT) learned to encode some linguistic property?
Usually this question is narrowed down to the following.

</br></br>
<u>We have:</u></br> data
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data-min.png" height="22">, where
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_x-min.png" height="19"> are representations from a model and
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y-min.png" height="21"> are labels for some linguistic task
(<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/y_is_clf-min.png" height="19">).

</br>
<u>We want:</u></br> to measure to what extent
representations <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_x_prefix-min.png" height="19"> capture labels
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22">.
</br></br>



<h4>Standard Probing: train a classifier, use its accuracy</h4>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/standard_probe-min.png" width="400" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >
The most popular approach is to use probing classifiers (aka probes, probing tasks, diagnostic classifiers).
These classifiers are trained to predict a linguistic property from frozen representations,
and accuracy of the classifier is used to measure how well these representations encode the property.
</br>
Looks reasonable and simple, right? Yes, but...
</br></br>

<h4>Wait, how about some sanity checks?</h4>
<!--
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/random_model_and_labels_close-min.png" width="400" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >
-->
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/random_model_with_head-min.png" width="170" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >


While such probes are extremely popular, several 'sanity checks' showed that
<u>differences in accuracies fail to reflect differences in representations.</u>
</br></br>
These sanity checks are different kinds of random baselines. For example,
<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5448">Zhang & Bowman (2018)</a> compared
probe scores for trained models and randomly initialized ones. They were able to see reasonable differences in the scores
only when <u>reducing the amount of a classifier training data</u>.</br></br>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/random_labels_with_head-min.png" width="170" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >
Later <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1275">Hewitt & Liang (2019)</a> proposed to
put probe accuracy in context with its ability to remember from word types. They constructed so-called 'control tasks',
which are manually constructed for each linguistic task. A control task defines random output for a word type,
regardless of context. For example, for POS tags, each word is assigned
a random label based on the empirical distribution of tags. </br>

Control tasks were used to perform an exhaustive search over hyperparameters for training probes and
to find a setting with the largest
difference in the scores. This was achieved by <u>reducing size of a probing model</u> (e.g., fewer neurons).


</br></br>

<h4>Houston, we have a problem.</h4>

We see that accuracy of a probe does not always reflect what we want it to reflect, at least not without explicit
search for a setting where it does. But then another problem arises: if we tune a probe to behave in a certain way for one task
(e.g., we tune its setting to have low accuracy for a certain control task), how do we know if it's still reasonable
for other tasks? Well, we do not (if you do, please tell!).


</br></br>

All in all, <font face="symbol">we want a probing method which does not require a human to tell it what to say</font>.

</br></br>


<h2>Information-Theoretic Viewpoint</h2>


Let us come back to the initial task: we have data <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data-min.png" height="22">
with representations <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_x_prefix-min.png" height="19"> and labels
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22"> and want to measure to what extent
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_x_prefix-min.png" height="19"> encode
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22">.
Let us look at this task from a new perspective, different from the current most popular approach.
</br>
Our idea can be summarized in two sentences.

</br></br>
<!--<span style="background-color:#ebf0df">-->
<span style="background-color:#f6faed">

    <font face="symbol">
    <u>Regularity</u> in representations with respect to labels can be <u>exploited to compress</u> the data.</br>
    Better compression &#8596; stronger regularity &#8596; representations better encode labels.</font>
</span>

</br></br>

Basically, this is it. All is left is to make it clear, theoretically justified and illustrated experimentally.
For this, I will need some help from Alice and Bob.
</br></br>

<h3>Adventures of Alice, Bob and the Data</h3>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/alice_bob-min.png" width="700" style="margin-bottom:25px">

</br>
Let us imagine that Alice has all pairs <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/pair_xi_yi-min.png" height="22">
from <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/D-min.png" height="19">, Bob has just
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_x_prefix-min.png" height="19">, and that Alice wants to communicate
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22"> to Bob. Transmitting data is
a lot of work, and surely Alice has much better things to do: let's help Alice to compress the data!
</br></br>

Formally, the task is to encode labels <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22">
knowing representations <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_x_prefix-min.png" height="19"> in an optimal way,
i.e., with minimal codelength (in bits) needed to transmit
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22">.
The resulting minimal number of bits is <font face="symbol">minimum description length (MDL)</font>
of labels given representations, and we will refer to probes measuring MDL as
<font face="symbol">description length probes</font> or <font face="symbol">MDL probes</font>.

</br></br>

<h4>Changing a probe's goal converts it into an MDL probe</h4>

Turns out that to evaluate MDL we don't need to change much in standard probe-training pipelines.
This is done via a simple trick: we know that data can be compressed using some probabilistic model
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_y_x-min.png" height="22">, and we just set this model
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_y_x-min.png" height="22"> to be a probing classifier. This is how
we turn a standard probe into an MDL probe by <u>changing a goal from predicting labels to transmitting data</u>.

</br></br>



<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/mdl_logo_full-min.png" width="350" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >

Note that since Bob does not know the precise model Alice is using, we will also have to
transmit the model, either explicitly or implicitly. Thus, the overall codelength is a combination
of quality-of-fit of the model (compressed data length), together with the cost of transmitting the model itself.
</br></br>

Intuitively, codelength characterizes not only <font face="symbol">final quality</font> of a probe
(data codelength), but also
the <font face="symbol">amount of effort</font> needed to achieve this quality.

</br></br>
<!--<font face="symbol" color="#dea404">model</font> <font face="symbol" color="#85a81d">data</font>-->

<h3>The <font face="symbol">Data</font> Part</h3>
<h4>TL;DR: cross-entropy is the data codelength</h4>

Let's assume for now Alice and Bob have agreed in advance on a model
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_y_x-min.png" height="22"> and both know the inputs
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_x_prefix-min.png" height="19">;
we need just to transmit data using this known model.
Then there exists a code to transmit the labels
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22">
losslessly with codelength
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_codelength-min.png" height="60">
</center>
This is the <font face="symbol">Shannon-Huffman code</font>, which gives the optimal bound on the codelength
if the data are independent and come from a conditional probability distribution
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_y_x-min.png" height="22">.

</br></br>

<h4>Learning is Compression</h4>
Note that (1) is exactly the categorical cross-entropy
loss evaluated on the model <i>p</i>. This shows that <font face="symbol">the task of compressing labels</font>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/data_y_prefix-min.png" height="22">
is <font face="symbol">equivalent to learning a model</font> <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_y_x-min.png" height="22">
of data:</br>
quality of a learned model <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_y_x-min.png" height="22">
    is the codelength needed to transmit the data.
</br></br>


<h4>Compression is compared against Uniform Code</h4>

Compression is usually compared against <font face="symbol">uniform encoding</font>
which does not require any learning from data. For <i>K</i> classes,
it assumes <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_uniform-min.png" height="24">, and yields
codelength <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/code_uniform-min.png" height="21"> bits.



</br></br>

<h3>The <font face="symbol">Amount of Effort</font> Part: <span style="font-size:20px;">Strength of the Regularity in the Data</span></h3>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/regularity-min.png" width="700">
</br>
<span style="font-size:12px;">
    <u>Based on real events!</u> These are t-sne projections of representations of different occurrences of
    the token <font face="symbol">is</font> from the last layer of MT encoder (strong) and the last LM layer (weak).
    The colors show CCG tags (only 4 most frequent tags). </br>
    Curious why MT and LM behave this way? Look at our
    <a href="https://lena-voita.github.io/posts/emnlp19_evolution.html">Evolution of Representations</a> post!
</span>
</br></br>
Now we come to the other component of the total codelength, which
characterizes how hard it is to achieve final quality of a trained probe. Intuitively,
if representations have some <font face="symbol">clear structure</font> with respect to labels, this structure can be
understood with
<font face="symbol">less effort</font>; for example,
<ul>
    <li>the "rule" explaining this structure (i.e., a probing model) can be
        simple, and/or</li>
    <li>the amount of data needed to reveal this structure can be small.</li>
</ul>
This is exactly how our vague (so far) notion of the "amount of effort" is translated into codelength.
We explain this more formally when describing the two methods for evaluating MDL we use:
<font face="symbol">variational coding</font> and <font face="symbol">online coding</font>;
they differ in a way they incorporate
model cost: directly or indirectly.
</br></br>


<h4><u><font face="symbol">Variational Code</font></u>: Explicit Transmission of the Model</h4>


<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/variational_scheme-min.png" width="300" style="float:right; margin-left:30px" >

Variational code is an  instance  of <font face="symbol">two-part codes</font>,
where a model (probe weights) is transmitted explicitly and then used to encode the data.
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1310354">It has been known for quite a while</a> that
this joint cost (model and data codes) is exactly the loss function of a variational learning methods.
</br></br>

<h4>The Idea: Informal version</h4>
What is happening in this part:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li>model weights are transmitted explicitly;</li>
    <li>each weight is treated as a random variable;</li>
    <li>weights with higher variance can be transmitted with lower precision (i.e., fewer bits);</li>
    <li>by choosing sparsity-inducing priors we will obtain induced (sparse) probe architectures.</li>
</ul>
</br>

<h4>Codelength: Formal Derivations</h4>

<details>
    <summary><font face="symbol" color="#658a01">I hereby confirm that I'm not afraid of scary formulas
          <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/ghost-min.png" height="24">
        </font></summary>
    </br>

    <h4>May the force be with you!</h4>
Here
we assume that Alice and Bob have agreed on a model class
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/model_class_h-min.png" height="20">,
and for any model <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_theta_of_theta_ast-min.png" height="20">,
Alice first transmits its parameters <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/theta_ast-min.png" height="20">
and then encodes the data while relying on the model.
The description length decomposes accordingly:
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/two_part_equation_with_bottom-min.png" height="70">
</center>
To compute the description length of the parameters,
we can further assume that Alice and Bob have agreed on a prior distribution over the
parameters <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/alpha_param_prior-min.png" height="22">.
Now, we can rewrite the total description length as
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/two_part_with_prior_and_bottom-min.png" height="70">
</center>
where parameters <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/m-min.png" height="16">
is the number of parameters and <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/epsilon-min.png" height="16">
is a prearranged precision for each parameter.
With deep learning models (in our case, probing classifiers),
such straightforward codes for parameters
are highly inefficient.
Instead, in the variational approach,
weights are treated as random variables,
and the description length is given by the expectation
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/var_equation_with_bottom-min.png" height="70" style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:10px">
</center>
where <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/beta_is_prod-min.png" height="21">
is a distribution encoding uncertainty about the parameter values.
The distribution <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/beta_of_theta-min.png" height="19">
is chosen by minimizing the codelength given in Eq. (3).
In you are interested in the formal justification for the description length,
it relies on the <font face="symbol">bits-back</font> argument and can be found, for example,
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/colt93.pdf">here</a>.
However, the underlying intuition is straightforward:
<u>parameters we are uncertain about can be transmitted
    at a lower cost</u> as
the uncertainty
 can be used to determine the required
precision. The entropy term in equation (3),
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/the_entropy_term-min.png" height="21">,
quantifies this discount.
</br></br>
The negated codelength <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/l_beta_var-min.png" height="22">
is known as the evidence-lower-bound (ELBO) and used as the objective in variational inference.
The distribution <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/beta_of_theta-min.png" height="19">
approximates the intractable posterior distribution
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_theta_posterior-min.png" height="21">.
Consequently, any variational method can in principle be used to estimate the  codelength.

<h4>We Use: Bayesian Compression</h4>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/sparse_nns_0.1_0.2_min-min.png" width="290" style="float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:20px">

The specific variational method we use in our experiments is the
<a href="https://github.com/KarenUllrich/Tutorial_BayesianCompressionForDL">bayesian network compression method</a>.
Similarly to <a href="https://github.com/senya-ashukha/variational-dropout-sparsifies-dnn">variational dropout</a>,
it uses sparsity-inducing priors on the parameters, pruning neurons from the probing
classifier as a byproduct of optimizing the ELBO. As a result we can assess the  probe complexity
both using its description length
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/kl_beta_alpha-min.png" height="19">
and by inspecting the  discovered architecture.

<h4>We Use: Bayesian Compression</h4>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/sparse_nns_0.1_0.2_min-min.png" width="290" style="float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:20px">

You can choose  priors for weights to get something interesting. For example, if you choose
sparsity-inducing priors on the parameters, you can get
<a href="https://github.com/senya-ashukha/variational-dropout-sparsifies-dnn">variational dropout</a>.
What is more interesting, you can do this in such way that you prune the whole neurons (not just individual weights): this is the
<a href="https://github.com/KarenUllrich/Tutorial_BayesianCompressionForDL">
    <font face="symbol">Bayesian network compression method</font></a> we use.
 This allows us to assess the  probe complexity
both using its description length
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/kl_beta_alpha-min.png" height="19">
and <font face="symbol">by inspecting the  discovered architecture</font>.


</br></br>

<h4>Intuition</h4>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/regularity_separate_h_model-min.png" width="300" style="float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:15px" >

If <font face="symbol">regularity</font> in the data <font face="symbol">is strong</font>,
it can be <font face="symbol">explained with a "simple rule"</font> (i.e., a small probing model).
A small probing model is easy to communicate, i.e., only a few parameters require high precision.
As we will see in the experiments,
similar probe accuracies often come at a very different model cost, i.e. different total codelength.

</br></br>
Note that the variational code gives us probe architecture (and model size) as a
<font face="symbol">byproduct of training</font>, and <font face="symbol">does not require
    manual search</font> over probe hyperparameters.

</br></br>
</br>



<h4><u><font face="symbol">Online Code</font></u>: Implicit Transmission of the Model</h4>

Online code provides a way to transmit data <font face="symbol">without directly transmitting the model</font>. Intuitively, it
measures the ability to learn from different amounts of data.</br></br>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/online_scheme-min.png" width="350"
     style="float:right; margin-left:30px; margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:15px" >

 In this setting, the data is transmitted in
a sequence of portions; at each step, the data transmitted so far is used to understand the regularity
in this data and compress the following portion.
</br></br>

<h4>Codelength: Formal Derivations</h4>
Formally, Alice and Bob agree on the form of the model
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/p_theta_y_x-min.png" height="20">
with learnable parameters <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/theta-min.png" height="19">,
its initial random seeds, and its learning algorithm. They also choose timesteps
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/online_timesteps-min.png" height="16">
and encode data by blocks. Alice starts by communicating

This process continues until the entire dataset is transmitted. The resulting online codelength is

<h4>Data and Model components of Online Code</h4>
While the online code does not incorporate model cost explicitly, we can still evaluate model cost by interpreting
the difference between the cross-entropy of the model trained on all data,
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/xent_s_portion-min.png" height="22">,
and online codelength as the cost of the model:

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/online_equation_data_model_with_bottom-min.png" height="70" style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:10px">
</center>

Indeed, <img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/xent_s_portion-min.png" height="22">
is codelength of the data if one knows model parameters,
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/l_online-min.png" height="22"> - if one does not know them.

<h4>Intuition</h4>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/regularity_separate_h_data-min.png" width="300" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >

Online code
measures the ability to learn from different amounts of data, and
it is related to the <font face="symbol">area under the learning curve</font>, which plots quality
as a function of the number of training examples.
</br></br>
Intuitively, if the <font face="symbol">regularity</font> in the data <font face="symbol">is strong</font>, it can be
<font face="symbol">revealed
    using a small subset of the data</font>, i.e., early in the transmission process, and can be exploited to efficiently
transmit the rest of the dataset.

</br></br>





<h2>Description Length and Control Tasks</h2>


<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/control_table_with_pict_and_caption-min.png" width="800">
</br></br>

<h4>Compression methods agree in results:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li>for the linguistic task, the best layer is the first;</li>
    <li>for the control task, codes become
        larger as we move up from the embedding layer</br>
        (this is expected since the control task measures the ability to remember word types);
    </li>
    <li><font face="symbol">codelengths for the control task are substantially larger than for
        the linguistic task</font>.
    </li>
</ul>


<h4><u>Layer 0</u>: MDL is correct, accuracy is not.</h4>

What is even more surprising, <font face="symbol">codelength identifies the control task even when accuracy indicates the opposite</font>:
for layer 0, accuracy for the control task is higher, but
the code is twice longer than for the linguistic task.
This is because codelength characterizes how hard it is to achieve this accuracy:
for the control task, <font face="symbol">accuracy is higher, but the cost of achieving this score is very big</font>.
We will illustrate this a bit later when looking at the model component of the code.</br></br>

<h4><u>Embedding vs contextual</u>:  drastic difference.</h4>

For the linguistic task,
note that codelength for the embedding layer is approximately twice larger than that for the first layer.
Later, when looking at the random model baseline, we will see the same trends for several other tasks
and will show that even contextualized representations obtained with a randomly initialized model are a lot
better than the embedding layer alone.

</br></br>

<h4><u>Model</u>: small for linguistic, large for control.</h4>

Let us now look at the data and model components of code separately
(as shown in formulas (3) and (5) for variational and online codes, respectively).
</br></br>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/both_by_type_control_pos-min.png" width="400" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >

The trends for the two compression methods are similar:
for the control
task, model size is several times larger than for the linguistic task. This is something that
<font face="symbol">probe accuracy alone is not able to reflect</font>:
while representations have structure with respect to the linguistic task labels,
the same <font face="symbol">representations do not have structure with
    respect to random labels</font>.</br></br>
For variational code, it means that the linguistic task labels can be "explained"
with a small model, but random labels can be learned only using a larger model.
</br>
For online code, it shows that the linguistic task labels can be learned
from a small amount of data, but random labels can be learned (memorized) well only using a large dataset.


</br>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/online_acc_curve-min.png" width="200" style="float:right; margin-left:20px" >

</br>
For online code, we can also recall that it is related to the area under the learning curve, which plots quality as a function of the number of training examples.
This figure shows
learning curves corresponding to online code. We can clearly see the difference between behavior of the linguistic and control tasks.


</br></br></br>

<h4><u>Architecture</u>: sparse for linguistic, dense for control.</h4>


<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/control_bayes_arc_with_pict-min.png" width="255" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >

Let us now recall that <a href="https://github.com/KarenUllrich/Tutorial_BayesianCompressionForDL">Bayesian compression</a>
gives us not only variational codelength, but also the induced probe architecture.
</br></br>
Probes learned for linguistic tasks have small architectures with only 33-75 neurons at the second
and third layers of the probe. In contrast, models learned for control tasks are quite dense.

</br></br>
This relates to the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1275.pdf">control tasks</a>
paper which proposed to use random label baselines.
The authors considered several predefined
probe architectures and picked one of them based on a manually defined criterion. In contrast, variational
code gives probe architecture as a <font face="symbol">byproduct of training</font> and
<font face="symbol">does not require human guidance</font>.

</br></br>


<h3>MDL results are stable, accuracy is not</h3>

<h4><u>Hyperparameters</u>: change results for accuracy but not for MDL.</h4>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/control_settings_with_annotation-min.png" width="400" style="float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:15px" >

 While here we discussed in detail results for the default settings, we also tried
10 different settings and saw that <font face="symbol">accuracy varies greatly with the settings</font>.
For example,  for layer 0 there are settings with contradictory
results: accuracy can be higher either for the linguistic or for the control task depending on the settings
(look at the figure). In striking contrast to accuracy,
<font face="symbol">MDL results are stable across settings</font>, thus
<font face="symbol">MDL does not require search for probe settings</font>.
</br></br>

<h4><u>Random Seed</u>: affects accuracy but not MDL.</h4>
<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/control_seeds_with_annotation-min.png" width="350" style="float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:15px" >

Figure shows results for 5 random seeds (linguistic task).
We see that using accuracy can lead to different
rankings of layers depending on a random seed, making it hard to draw conclusions about their relative qualities.
For example, accuracy for layer 1 and layer 2 are 97.48 and 97.31 for seed 1, but 97.38 and 97.48
for seed 0.
</br>
On the contrary, the <font face="symbol">MDL results are stable and the scores given to different layers are well separated</font>.

</br></br>


<h2>Description Length and Random Models</h2>



<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/jiant_5_tasks-min.png" width="800">
</br></br>

<img src="../resources/posts/mdl_probes/random_model_with_head-min.png" width="170" style="float:right; margin-left:15px" >

In the paper, we also consider another type of random baselines: randomly initialized models.
 Following previous work, we also experiment with ELMo and compare it with a version of the ELMo model in which all weights above the lexical
layer (layer 0) are replaced with random orthonormal matrices (but the embedding layer,
layer 0, is retained from trained ELMo).
</br></br>

We experiment with 7 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06316.pdf">edge probing tasks</a> (5 of them are listed above).
Here we will only briefly mention our findings: if you are interested in more details, look at the paper.

</br></br>

<h4>We find, that:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li><font face="symbol">layer 0 vs contextual: even random contextual representations are better</font></br>
        As we already saw in the previous part, codelength shows a drastic difference between the
        embedding layer (layer 0) and contextualized representations: codelengths differ about twice for most tasks.
        Both compression methods show that even for the randomly initialized model,
        contextualized representations are better than lexical representations.
        </li></br>
    <li><font face="symbol">codelengths for the randomly initialized model are larger than for the trained one</font></br>
This is more prominent when not just looking at the bare scores, but comparing compression against
        context-agnostic representations. For all tasks, compression bounds for the randomly
        initialized model are closer to those of context-agnostic Layer 0 than to representations
        from the trained model.
        This shows that <u>gain from using context for the randomly initialized model is at least twice smaller than
            for the trained model</u>.
    </li></br>
    <li><font face="symbol">randomly initialized layers do not evolve</font></br>
        For all tasks, MDL (and data/model components of code separately) for layers of the randomly initialized model is identical.
For the trained model, this is not the case: layer 2 is worse than layer 1 for all tasks.
        This is one more illustration of the general process explained
        in our <a href="https://lena-voita.github.io/posts/emnlp19_evolution.html">Evolution of Representations</a> post:
        the way representations evolve between layers is
        defined by the training objective. For the randomly initialized model,
        since no training objective has been optimized, no evolution happens.
    </li>
</ul>


<h1>Conclusions</h1>

We propose information-theoretic probing which measures <font face="symbol">minimum description length (MDL)</font>
of labels given representations. We show that MDL naturally characterizes not only <font face="symbol">probe quality</font>,
but also <font face="symbol">the amount of effort</font> needed to achieve it (or, intuitively,
<font face="symbol">strength of the regularity</font> in representations with respect to the labels);
this is done in a  theoretically justified way without manual search for settings.
We explain how to easily measure MDL on top of standard probe-training pipelines. We show that results of
MDL probing are more informative and stable compared to the standard probes.
