        it is not possible to cover it all in a single lecture. Here I will try to give a general idea
        of transfer and will show some popular ways it is currently done.
    </font></p>

    <p>Before the era of Large Language Models (such as e.g. ChatGPT),
        <font face="arial">Transfer Learning</font> was likely to be the most popular NLP area both in research and
    industry. Most probably you've already heard people talking about ELMo, BERT, and other characters - after this
        lecture, you will understand why!
    </p>

    <h2>"Transfer" Knowledge from One Model to Another</h2>

    <p>The general idea of transfer learning is to "transfer" knowledge from one task/model to another.
        For example, you don't have a huge amount of data for the task you are interested in (e.g., classification),
        and it is hard to get a good model using only this data.
        Instead, you can have data for some other task, which is easier to get (e.g., for language modeling
        you don't need labels at all - plain texts are enough).</p>
    <center>
    <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/intro/idea-min.png"
             style="max-width:80%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
    </center>
        <p> In this case, you can
        "transfer" knowledge from the task you are not interested in
        (let's call it <font face="arial">source task</font>) to the task you care about, i.e.
        <font face="arial">target task</font>.
    </p>

<h2>A Taxonomy for Transfer Learning in NLP</h2>
    <p>There are several types of transfer that are categorized nicely in
        <a href="https://ruder.io/state-of-transfer-learning-in-nlp/"
               target="_blank">Sebastian Ruder's blog post</a>.
        Two large categories are <font face="arial">transductive</font> and
        <font face="arial">inductive</font> transfer learning:
        they divide all approaches into the ones where the task is the same
        and labels are only in the source (<font face="arial">transductive</font>),
        and where the tasks are different and labels are only in the target
        (<font face="arial">inductive</font>).
    </p>

    <p>In this lecture, we are interested in the latter, with different tasks, and

    <p class="data_text"><font color="#888"><u>Lena</u>: I'm usually reluctant to make such claims,
        but here I believe it is safe to say that
        sequential transfer learning is currently one of the most popular areas of research.

    <h2>What we'll be looking at</h2>
    <p>In this lecture, we are mostly interested in how the auxiliary models can look like and
    how the transfer itself looks on the modeling side.</p>

        <h1>The Simplest Transfer: Word Embeddings</h1>

        <p>When talking about <a href="./text_classification.html" target="_blank">Text Classification</a>,
            we already discussed that using pretrained word embeddings can help a lot.
            Let's recap this part here.
        </p>

        <h3><font face="arial"><u>Recap</u>: Embeddings in Text Classification</font></h3>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/text_clf/practical_tips/embeddings_what_to_do-min.png"
             style="max-width:60%; margin-bottom:20px;margin-left:20px;float:right;"/>
            <p>Input for a network is represented by word embeddings. You have three options
                on how to get these embeddings for your model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>train from scratch as part of your model,</li>
                    <li>take pretrained (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc) and fix them (use them as static vectors),</li>
                    <li>initialize with pretrained embeddings and train them with the network ("fine-tune").</li>
                </ul>

        <p>Let's think about these options by looking at the data a model can use.
            Training data for classification is labeled and task-specific,
            but labeled data is usually hard to get.
            Therefore, this corpus is likely to be not huge (at the very least), or not diverse, or both.
            On the contrary, training data for word embeddings are not labeled - plain texts are enough.
            Therefore, these datasets
            can be huge and diverse - a lot to learn from.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/text_clf/practical_tips/data_types-min.png"
             style="max-width:100%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>

        <p>Now let us think about what a model will know depending on what we do with the embeddings.
            If the embeddings are trained from scratch, the model will "know" only
            the classification data - this may not be enough to learn relationships between words well.
            But if we use pretrained embeddings, they (and, therefore, the whole model)
            will know a huge corpus - they will learn a lot about the world.
            To adapt these embeddings to your task-specific data,
            you can fine-tune these embeddings by training them with the
                whole network - this can bring gains in performance (not huge though).
        </p>

        <img src="../resources/lectures/text_clf/practical_tips/embs_what_to_do_with_data-min.png"
             style="max-width:100%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        <p>When we use pretrained embeddings, this is an example of
            <font face="arial">transfer learning</font>: through the embeddings, we "transfer" the knowledge
            of their training data to our task-specific model.

        </p>

        <h3><font face="arial">Transfer Through Word Embeddings</font></h3>
        <p>We just stated the main idea of using pretrained word embeddings in task-specific models:</p>
        <div class="green_left_thought" style="font-size:18px;">
                <p class="data_text">Through the embeddings, we "transfer" the knowledge
            of their training data to our task-specific model.</p>
            </div>

        <p>In a model, this transfer is implemented via replacing randomly initialized embeddings with
        the pretrained ones (what is the same, copying weights from pretrained embeddings to your model).
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/word_emb/transfer_scheme-min.png"
             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>
    <p>Note that
            <font face="arial">we do not change the model</font>: it stays exactly the same.
            As we will see a bit later, this won't always be the case.</p>


    </div>

<div id="pretrained_models">

   <h1>Pretrained Models</h1>

    <p>The idea of knowledge transfer we formulated for embeddings is general and stays the same when
        coming from word embeddings to pretrained models. I mean, literally the same: you can just
        replace "word embeddings" with your model's name!
    </p>

        <div class="green_left_thought" style="font-size:18px;">
            <p class="data_text">Through <strong>_insert_your_model_</strong>, we "transfer" the knowledge
            of its training data to a task-specific model.</p>
            </div>


    <h3><u>The Two Great Ideas</u></h3>

    <p>In this part, we are going to see 4 models: CoVe, ELMo, GPT, BERT.
        Note that now there are lots of variations of these models:
        ranging from very small modifications (e.g., training data and/or setting) to rather prominent
        ones (e.g., different training objectives). However,
        roughly speaking, the transition from word embeddings to the current state-of-the-art models
        can be explained with just two ideas.
    </p>


    <center>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/cove/great_ideas-min.png"
             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>

    <p>The two great ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><font face="arial">what is encoded</font>: from words to words-in-context<br>
            (the transition from Word2Vec/GloVe/etc. to
        Cove/ELMo);</li>
        <li><font face="arial">usage for downstream tasks</font>:
            from replacing only word embeddings in task-specific models to replacing entire task-specific models<br>
            (the transition from
        Cove/ELMo to GPT/BERT).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now, I will explain each of these ideas along with the corresponding models.</p>


    <div id="words_to_words_in_context">

        <h2><u>Great Idea 1</u>: From Words to Words-in-Context</h2>

        <p>As we just saw, knowledge transfer through learned vector representations
            existed long before pretrained models: in the simplest case, through representations of words.
            What made transfer much more effective (and, therefore, popular) is a very simple idea:

        </p>
        <div class="green_left_thought" style="font-size:18px;">
            <p class="data_text">Instead of representing individual words, we can learn to represent
                words <strong>along with the context they are used in</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Well, okay. But how do we do this?</h3>
        <p>Remember we trained neural language models? To train such a model you need the same kind
            of data that is used to train word embeddings: plain texts in natural language (e.g.,
            Wikipedia texts, or anything you want). Note that for this you don't need any kind of labels!
        </p>

        <p>Imagine now that we have some texts in natural language. We can use them to train word embeddings
            (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.) or a neural language model. But by training a language model we get much more
            than by training word embeddings: language models process not just individual words, but sentences/paragraphs/etc.
            Inside a model, LMs too build vector representations for each word, but
            these vectors represent not just words, but <font face="arial">words in context</font>.
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/words_to_context-min.png"
             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>

        <p>For example, let us look at the sentence <span class="data_text"><strong>I saw a cat on a mat</strong></span>
            and the word <span class="data_text"><strong>cat</strong></span> in it.
            If we use word embeddings, the vector for
            <span class="data_text"><strong>cat</strong></span> will contain information about the general notion of
            <span class="data_text"><strong>cat</strong></span>: this can be any kind of cat you can imagine.
            But if we take a vector for the <span class="data_text"><strong>cat</strong></span>
            from somewhere inside a language model, this won't be any <span class="data_text"><strong>cat</strong></span>
            anymore! Since LMs read the context, this vector representation for
            <span class="data_text"><strong>cat</strong></span> will know that this is
            the <span class="data_text"><strong>cat</strong></span>
            that <span class="data_text"><strong>I saw</strong></span>, the one who
            <span class="data_text"><strong>sat on the mat</strong></span>.
        </p>



        <h3><u>Transfer</u>: Put Representations Instead of Word Embeddings</h3>


        <p>We are going to see the two models that first implemented the idea of encoding words with context:
            <a href="#cove">CoVe</a>
            and <a href="elmo">ELMo</a>.
            The way their representations are used for downstream tasks is almost the same
        as with word embeddings: usually, you just have to put representations instead of word embeddings
            (the place where previously you put e.g. GloVe). That's it!
        </p>
        <center>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/elmo/transfer_scheme-min.png"
             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>

        <p>Note that here you still have a task-specific model for each task, and these task-specific models
            can be quite different. What's changed is the way we encode words before feeding them to
            these task-specific models.
        </p>
        <p class="data_text"><font color="#888"><u>Lena</u>: In the original papers, the authors propose
            some modifications for the task-specific models. These, however, are rather small, and
            roughly speaking can be ignored. What does matter is that instead of representing
            individual words, CoVe and ELMo represent words in context.
        </font></p>


        <h3><u>Now, all that's left</u> is to specify
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> this
        <span class="data_text"><strong>some model</strong></span> from the illustration,</li>
            <li>which representations to take from this model.</li>
            <!--<li>how to use these representations for specific tasks.</li>-->
        </ul>



    </div>



    <div id="cove">

        <h2><u>CoVe</u>: Contextualized Word Vectors Learned in Translation</h2>

        <p>CoVe stands for "Context Vectors" and was introduced in the NeurIPS 2017 paper
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00107.pdf" target="_blank">Learned in Translation: Contextualized Word Vectors</a>.
            The authors first proposed to learn how to encode not only individual words but
            words along with their context.
        </p>


        <h3><u>Model Training</u>: Neural Machine Translation (LSTMs and Attention)</h3>

        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/cove/mt_model-min.png"
             style="max-width:50%; margin-left:20px; float: right;"/>

        <p>To encode words in the context of a sentence/paragraph, CoVe train an NMT system and use its encoder.
            The main hypothesis is that to translate a sentence,
            NMT encoders learn to "understand" the source sentence. Therefore,
            vector representations from the encoder contain information about a word's context.
        </p>

        <p>Formally, the authors train an LSTM translation model with attention (e.g.,
            <a href="./seq2seq_and_attention.html#attention_bahdanau_luong" target="_blank">Bahdanau model
            we saw in the previous lecture</a>). Since in the end we want to use a trained encoder
            to process sentences in English (not because we care only about English, but because
            most of the datasets for downstream tasks are in English),
            the NMT system has to translate from English to some other language (e.g., German).
        </p>

        <p>Note that in this NMT model, the encoder is bidirectional: it concatenates outputs of
            the forward and backward LSTMs. Therefore, encoder output contains information about
            both left and right contexts of a token.

             style="max-width:40%; margin-left:20px; float: right;"/>

        <p>Once an NTM model is trained, we need only its encoder.
        For a given text, CoVe vectors are encoder outputs. For downstream tasks,
            the authors propose to use the concatenation of both Glove (which represent individual tokens)
            and CoVe (tokens encoded in context) vectors. The idea is that
            these vectors encode different kinds of information, and a combination of them can be useful.

        <h2><u>ELMo</u>: Embeddings from Language Models</h2>

        <p>The ELMo model was introduced in the paper
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365.pdf" target="_blank">Deep contextualized word representations</a>.
            Differently from CoVe, ELMo uses representations not from NMT model, but from a language model.
            Just by replacing word embeddings (GloVe) with embeddings from LM they got a huge improvement for
            several tasks such as question answering, coreference resolution, sentiment analysis,
            named entity recognition, and others. And, by the way, the paper got the Best Paper Award at NAACL 2018!
        </p>
        <p>Now let's look at ELMo in detail.</p>


        <h3><u>Model Training</u>: Forward and Backward LSTM-LMs on top of char-CNN</h3>

        <p>The model is very simple and it consists of the two-layer LSTM language models: forward and backward.
            The two models are used so that each token could have both contexts: left and right.
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/elmo/training-min.png"
             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>

        <p>What is also interesting, is how the authors get initial word representations (which are then
            fed to the LSTMs). Let us recall that in the standard word embedding layer,
            for each word in the vocabulary
            we train a unique vector. In this case,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>word embeddings do not know the characters they consist of (e.g., they don't know that
            the words <span class="data_text"><strong>represent</strong></span>,
            <span class="data_text"><strong>represents</strong></span>,
            <span class="data_text"><strong>represented</strong></span>, and
            <span class="data_text"><strong>representation</strong></span> are close in writing)</li>
            <li>we can not represent out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>To address these problems,
                the authors represent words as outputs of a
                character-level network. As we see from the illustration, this CNN is very simple and consists of
                the components we already saw before: convolution, global pooling,
                highway connections, and linear layers.
                In this way, word representations know their characters by construction,
                and we can represent even those words we've never seen in training.
            </p>


        <h3><u>Getting Representations</u>: Weight Representations from Different Layers</h3>

        <p>
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/elmo/bidirectional_explain-min.png"
             style="max-width:40%; margin-left:20px; float:right;"/>
        <p>Once the model is trained, we can use it to get word representations. For this, for each word we combine
            representations from the corresponding layers from the forward and backward LSTMs.
            By concatenating these forward and backward vectors we construct a
            word representation that "knows" about both left and right contexts.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, ELMo representations
            have three layers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><font face="arial">layer 0 (embeddings)</font> - output of the character-level CNN;</li>
            <li><font face="arial">layer 1</font> - concatenated representations from layer 1
                of both forward and backward LSTMs;</li>
            <li><font face="arial">layer 2</font> - concatenated representations from layer 2
                of both forward and backward LSTMs.</li>
        </ul>

        <center>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/elmo/gather_layers-min.png"
             style="max-width:100%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>

        <h4><font face="arial">Layers contain different information → combine them</font></h4>
        <p>Each of these layers encodes different kinds of information: layer 0 - only word-level,
            layers 1 and 2 - words in context. Comparing between layers 1 and 2,
            layer 2 is likely to contain more high-level information:
            these representations come from the higher layers of the corresponding LMs.
        </p>
        <p>Since different downstream tasks need different kinds of information, ELMo
            uses task-specific weights to combine representations from the three layers. These are scalars that
            are learned for each downstream task. The resulting vector, the weighted sum of
            representations from all layers, is used to represent a word.
        </p>

    <div id="great_idea2">

        <h2><u>Great Idea 2</u>: Refuse From Task-Specific Models</h2>

        <p>The next two (classes of) models we are going to see are <a href="#gpt">GPT</a> and <a href="#bert">BERT</a>
            which are very different from the previous approaches in a way they are used for downstream tasks:
        </p>
        <div class="green_left_thought" style="font-size:18px;">
            <p class="data_text">CoVe/ELMo replace word embeddings,
                but GPT/BERT replace <strong>entire models</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>


        <h3><u>Before</u>: Specific model architecture for each downstream task</h3>

        <p>
            Note that ELMo/CoVe representations were mainly used to replace the embedding layer,
            and kept task-specific model architectures almost intact. This means e.g. that for coreference resolution,
            one had to use a specific model designed for this task, for part-of-speech tagging - some other model,
            for question answering - another, very peculiar model, etc. For each of these tasks, researchers
            specializing in it
            kept improving the task-specific model architectures.
        </p>

        <h3><u>After</u>: Single model which can be fine-tuned for all tasks</h3>

        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/bert/before_after-min.png"
             style="max-width:55%; margin-left:20px; margin-bottom:20px; float:right;"/>

        <p>
            In contrast to previous models, GPT/BERT act not as a replacement for word embeddings,
            but as a <font face="arial">replacement for task-specific models</font>.

            In this new setting, a model is first pretrained using a huge amount of unlabeled data (plain texts).
            Then, this model is fine-tuned on each of the downstream tasks.
            What is important,
            now during fine-tuning you have to only
            use task-aware input transformations (i.e. feed the data in a certain way)
            <font face="arial">instead of</font>
            modifying model architecture.

        <h2><u>GPT</u>: Generative Pre-Training for Language Understanding</h2>


        <!--<p>Remember our first great idea? We wanted to teach some kind of a model
            to process texts and make this model to encode a token's context. What is important, is that
            we wanted to do this by
            using unlabeled data (i.e., plain texts) because such data is easy to get.
            For this, the left-to-right language modeling objective (used in ELMo) is the standard thing to do:
            the language modeling task is complicated enough to teach a model to learn something about
            language.
        </p>
        <p>Well, replacing LSTMs with Transformer and still using left-to-right language modeling pretraining
            seems a reasonable thing to do (you'd get GPT which we'll see in a couple of minutes).
            But! Note that BERT stands for "Bidirectional

        <p>GPT is a Transformer-based left-to-right language model.
            The architecture is a 12-layer Transformer decoder (without decoder-encoder attention).
        </p>

        <p>Formally, if \(y_1, \dots, y_n\) is a training token sequence,
            then at the timestep \(t\) a model predicts a probability distribution
            \(p^{(t)} = p(\ast|y_1, \dots, y_{t-1})\). The model is trained with the standard cross-entropy loss,
            and the loss for the whole sequence is
        </p>
        \[L_{xent}=-\sum\limits_{t=1}^n\log(p(y_t| y_{\mbox{<}t})).\]

            Note that these models are so big, that only huge companies can afford to train one.
            This gave rise to lots of discussions of concerns related to the use of such huge models
            (ethical, environmental, etc.). If you are interested in these, you can easily find

        <h2><u>BERT</u>: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers</h2>

        <p>BERT was introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf" target="_blank">
            BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding</a>.
            If ELMo received the Best Paper Award at NAACL 2018, BERT did the same a year later,
            at NAACL 2019 :) Let's try to
            understand why.
        </p>

        <p>BERT's model architecture is very simple and you already know how it works:
            it's just the Transformer's encoder. What is new, is the training objectives and the way
            BERT is used for downstream tasks.
        </p>

             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>

        <p>How can we train a (bidirectional) <font face="arial">encoder</font> using plain texts?
            We know only the left-to-right language modeling objective, but it is applicable only for
            decoders where each token can use only previous ones (and does not see the future).
            The BERT's authors came up with
            other training objectives for unlabeled data. Before we come to them, let's first
            look at what BERT gives as input to the Transformer's encoder.

        <h3><u>Training Input</u>: Pairs of Sentences with Special Tokens</h3>

        <p>In training, BERT sees pairs of sentences separated with a special token-separator
            <span class="data_text"><strong>[SEP]</strong></span>. Another special token is <span class="data_text"><strong>[CLS]</strong></span>. In training,
            it is used for the NSP objective we'll see next. Once a model is trained, it is
            used for downstream tasks.
        </p>

             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </p>

        <p>To let the model easily distinguish
            between these sentences, in addition to token and positional embeddings it uses
            segment embeddings. Overall, input for the model is sum of token, positional and segment embeddings.
            These representations are fed into transformer encoder, and the representations on top are used
            first for training, then for downstream applications.

        <h3><u>Pre-Training Objectives</u>: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) Objective</h3>

        <p>The Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective is a binary classification task. From
            the final-layer representation of the special token
            <span class="data_text"><strong>[CLS]</strong></span>, the model predicts whether the
            two sentences are consecutive sentences in some text or not. Note that in training,
            50% of examples contain consecutive sentences extracted from
            training texts
            and another 50% - a random pair of sentences. Look at a couple of examples from
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf" target="_blank">the original paper</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="data_text"><font color="#888"><u>Input</u>:</font> <strong>[CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP] he bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]</strong><br>
        <font color="#888"><u>Label</u>:</font> isNext</p>
        <p class="data_text"><font color="#888"><u>Input</u>:</font> <strong>[CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP] penguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]
</strong><br>
        <font color="#888"><u>Label</u>:</font> notNext</p>

        <p>This task teaches the model to understand the relationships between
        sentences. As we'll see later, this will enable to use BERT for complicated tasks
            requiring some kind of reasoning.
        </p>


        <h3><u>Pre-Training Objectives</u>: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) Objective</h3>

        <p>BERT has two training objectives, and the most important of them is the
            Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective. is  With the MLM objective,
            at step the following happens:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><font face="arial">select some tokens</font><br>
            (each token is selected with the probability of 15%)
            </li>
            <li><font face="arial">replace these selected tokens</font><br>
                (with the special token <span class="data_text"><strong>[MASK]</strong></span> - with p=80%,
                with a random token - with p=10%, with the original token (remain unchanged) - with p=10%)
            </li>
            <li><font face="arial">predict original tokens (compute loss)</font>.

        </ul>

        <p>MLM is still language modeling: the goal is to predict some tokens in a sentence/text
        based on some part of this text. To make it more clear, let us compare MLM with the standard left-to-right
            language modeling objective.

        <p>At each step, the standard left-to-right LMs predict the next token based on the previous ones.

            <font face="arial">do not see the future</font>.
        </p>
        <p>Differently, MLMs see the whole text at once, but some tokens are corrupted: that's why
            BERT is <font face="arial">bidirectional</font>. Note that to let ELMo know both left and right
            contexts, the authors had to train two different unidirectional LMs and then concatenate representations
            of both of them. In BERT, we don't need to do that: one model is enough.

        <h3><u>Fine-Tuning:</u> Using BERT for Downstream Tasks</h3>

        <p>Now let's look at how to apply BERT for different tasks. For now, we will
            only at the simple setting: when the pretrained model is fine-tuned
            on each of the downstream tasks. Later, we'll see other ways to adapt
            a model for different applications (e.g., in the <a href="#adapters">Adapters</a> section).

        <h1>(A Bit of) Adapters: Parameter-Efficient Transfer</h1>

        <p>So far, we considered only the standard way of transferring knowledge from pretrained models (e.g. BERT)
            to downstream tasks: fine-tuning. "Fine-tuning" means that you take a pretrained model
            and train in for the task you are interested in (e.g., sentiment classification)
            with a rather small learning rate. This means that
            firstly,
            you update the whole (large) model, and secondly,
            for each task, you need to fine-tune a separate copy of your pretrained model.
            In the end, for several downstream tasks you end up with a lot of large models - this is highly inefficient!</p>
        <center>
        <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/adapters/idea-min.png"
             style="max-width:100%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
        </center>

        <p>As an alternative, the ICML 2019 paper
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00751.pdf" target="_blank">Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP</a>
            proposed transfer
            with adapter modules. In this setting, the parameters of the original model are fixed,
            and one has to train only a few trainable parameters per task: these new task-specific parameters
            are called <font face="arial">adaptors</font>.

            With adapter modules, transfer becomes very efficient: the largest part, the pretrained model,
            is shared between all downstream tasks.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;  display: block;
         margin-top:0px; max-width:100%;">
            <img width=100% src="../resources/lectures/transfer/adapters/adapter-min.png" alt="" /><br />
            <span style="font-size: small;">
                The figure is from the paper
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00751.pdf" target="_blank">Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP</a>.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>An example of an adapter module and a transformer layer with adapters is shown in the figure.
        As you can see, an adapter module is very simple: it's just a two-layer feed-forward network with a nonlinearity.
            What is important, the hidden dimensionality of this network is small,
            which means that the total number of parameters in the adapter is also small. This is what
            makes adaptors very efficient.
        </p>


        <h2>Other Adapters and Some Resources</h2>

        <p>Now, there are many different modifications of adaptors for lots of tasks and models.
            For example, the <a href="https://adapterhub.ml" target="_blank">AdapterHub</a> repository contains pre-trained adapter modules.
            Since this was a system demo at EMNLP 2020, it can be a good starting point
            if you want to find links to the latest adapter versions
            (<font class="data_text" color="#888"><u>Lena</u>: At least, at the moment I'm writing this: beginning

    <p>First, let us recap the analysis methods we already used in the previous lectures:
        looking at model components (e.g. neurons in CNNs/LSTMs and attention heads in Transformer),
        probing for linguistic structure (e.g., whether NMT representations encode information about morphology),
        and evaluating specific phenomena by looking at a model's predictions (e.g.,
        evaluating subject-verb agreement in language models).
        Today, we will see what happens when the same methods are applied to BERT.

        shows that some of the BERT's heads have simple patterns: not only positional (when all tokens attend to
        the previous or next token) but also heads putting all their attention mass to some tokens,
        e.g. the special token <span class="data_text"><strong>[SEP]</strong></span> of the period.

    <h3><u>Syntactic Heads</u> </h3>

    <p>Similar to
        <a ref="./seq2seq_and_attention.html#analysis_interpretability" target="_blank">syntactic self-attention heads found
        for NMT Transformer</a>,
        there were also found several BERT heads that specialize in tracking certain syntactic functions.
        Look at the illustration.
    </p>
    <p>Note that there are also some other works looking at attention functions in BERT. For example,
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12246.pdf" target="_blank">Do Attention Heads in BERT Track Syntactic Dependencies?</a>
        confirm that some BERT heads are indeed syntactic, while some other works
        fail to find heads that do this confidently. As always, you need to be very careful :)

                    <font face="arial">Transformer and the Residual Stream</font></h4>
    <div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;">
            <div>
                <p>As we learned in <a href="./seq2seq_and_attention.html#transformer_model_architecture" target="_blank">the
                    previous lecture</a>,
                    in the Transformer (either encoder or decoder)
                    a token representation evolves from the input token embedding to the final layer prediction.
                    Via residual connections, attention and feed-forward blocks update the original
                    representation by adding new information.
                    This sequence of evolving representations for the same token is called
                    <font face="arial">the residual stream</font>.
                </p>

        <p>Note that while attention layers allow exchanging information
            across tokens, FFNs operate within the same residual stream. Now, let us look at this
            layer more closely.
        </p>
            </div>

                    <font face="arial">The Key-Value View of FFNs</font></h4>

    <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14913.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>,
        the authors propose to view feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models as key-value memories.
        In this view, the columns of the first FFN layer encode textual concepts and
        the rows of the second FFN layer encode distributions over vocabulary.
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/analysis/ffns-min.png"
             style="max-width:90%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
    </center>
    <p>When our input vector goes into the FFN block, it first matches some of
        the concepts encoded in the first layer and receives the weights - in our illustration,
        this is shown in yellow.
        Then, these weights trigger the corresponding rows or the second FFN layer.
        These rows (multiplied by the weights) will update the output token distribution encoded in the residual stream.</p>

    <h2 id="nlp_pipeline"><font color="#888">Probing:</font>  BERT Rediscovers the Classical NLP Pipeline</h2>

    <p>Now there are plenty of papers applying probing to BERT.
    In this part, let's look at the ACL 2020 short paper
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05950.pdf" target="_blank">BERT Rediscovers the Classical NLP Pipeline</a>.
    </p>

    <h3><u>How:</u> Probing with a Bit of Creativity </h3>

    <p>In the previous lecture we learned about
        <a href="./seq2seq_and_attention.html#probing" target="_blank">standard probing for linguistic structure</a>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>feed the data to your pretrained model,</li>
        <li>get vector representations from some layer,</li>
        <li>train a probing
        classifier to predict linguistic labels from representations,</li>
        <li>use its accuracy as a measure of how well representations encode these labels.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course, this can be done for BERT, too. But BERT has lots of layers (e.g., 18 or 24) and
        to understand which layers better encode a certain task we would have to train 18 (or 24)
        probing classifiers for each task - this is lots of work!
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="../resources/lectures/transfer/analysis/probing-min.png"
             style="max-width:80%; margin-bottom:20px;"/>
    </center>

    <p>Luckily, the authors came up with a way to evaluate all layers at once.
        Instead of picking representations from each layer separately,
        to train a probing classifier
        they weight representations
        from all layers and learn the weights with a probing classifier (just like in ELMo!).
        Once the probing classifier is trained,
        the weights can serve as a measure of a layer's importance for a certain task.
    </p>



    <h3><u>What:</u> Edge Probing Tasks</h3>


    <p>The authors experiment with a set of
        <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzSgnRcKX" target="_blank"> edge probing tasks</a>.
        These are test sets for several linguistic tasks. Look at some examples below.
    </p>

    <p><span style="margin-right:15px;font-size:14px;">&#8226;</span>part of speech<br>
        <span class="data_text" style="margin-left:20px;">

    </p>

    <p><span style="margin-right:15px;font-size:14px;">&#8226;</span>semantic role labeling<br>
        <span class="data_text" style="margin-left:20px;">

    <h3><u>Results:</u> BERT Follows the Classical NLP Pipeline</h3>


    <p style="text-align: center;  display: block;
         margin-top:-10px; margin-left:15px; max-width:65%;float:right;">
            <img width=100% src="../resources/lectures/transfer/analysis/pipeline_results-min.png" alt="" /><br />
            <span style="font-size: small;">
                The figure with the results is from the paper
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05950.pdf" target="_blank">
              BERT Rediscovers the Classical NLP Pipeline</a>.</span></p>

<p>The results are shown in the figure to the right.
    The layers are shown from left to right, the weights for each layer are shown in dark blue.
</p>

    <p>We see that
        as you go from bottom to top layer, a layer's influence for each goes up, then down.
But the main result is not in the values per se, but in the way, BERT represents different
        linguistic tasks. In the classical NLP, there was an ordering of different tasks (this is the order
        shown in the figure and the order in which I showed you the examples for each task).
        To solve a subsequent task in classical NLP, one had to solve all the previous ones.
        What is interesting, <font face="arial">BERT represents these tasks in the same order</font>!
        For example, dependencies are represented later than part-of-speech tags, and coreference is learned
        later than both these tasks.
    </p>



    <br>
    <h2 id="predictions"><font color="#888">Looking at Predictions:</font>  Do ELMo and BERT Know Facts? </h2>

    <p>In the <a href="./language_modeling.html" target="_blank">Language Modeling</a> lecture, we learned how
        to evaluate language models for specific phenomena by looking at their predictions. In that lecture,
        we looked at a very popular subject-verb agreement task. Today,
        we will do something way more fun - check if a model <font face="arial">knows facts</font>!
        As an example, we use the EMNLP 2019 paper <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1250/" target="_blank">
              Language Models as Knowledge Bases?</a>.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;  display: block;
         margin-top:-10px; margin-left:15px; max-width:50%;float:right;">
            <img width=100% src="../resources/lectures/transfer/analysis/kb-min.png" alt="" /><br />
            <span style="font-size: small;">
                The figure with the results is from the paper
          <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1250/" target="_blank">
              Language Models as Knowledge Bases?</a></span>
    </p>

    <p>Usually, factual knowledge is stored in knowledge bases that contain triples
        <span class="data_text"><strong>(subject, relation, object)</strong></span>, for example,
        <span class="data_text"><strong>(Dante, born-in, Florence)</strong></span> as shown in the figure.
        However, these knowledge bases are hard to obtain:
        to extract knowledge, one usually has to use complicated pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>But what if pretrained language models (ELMo, BERT) already know the facts? Let's check!
        Instead of relation triplets,
        we will feed to a model a cloze-style sentence with a masked object. For example,
        we give our model a sentence <span class="data_text"><strong>Dante was born in ___</strong></span>
        and ask it to predict a token in place of a mask. Note that we do it without any fine-tuning -
        just a plain language model!
    </p>

    <p>Turns out, pretrained models can know facts quite well. Note that by "know" here we do not mean
        that they understand anything, but just that the training data statistics captured in
        these models can be used to extract facts. Look at some examples below (the original paper has more!).
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;  display: block;

              Language Models as Knowledge Bases?</a></span>
    </p>

    <p>What is more fun, we can look at not only formal facts but also common knowledge: look at the examples.
    For more details on the test set construction, see the paper.

    </p>
    <p>Let us come back to the key-value memory view of FFNs.
        The paper
        <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.581.pdf" target="_blank">
              Knowledge Neurons in Pretrained Transformers</a> looked at

    encode these relations! Specifically, each neuron activates whenever
    <font face="arial">(subject, relation)</font> pair is in the input, and
    triggers the row that encodes the <font face="arial">object</font>.
